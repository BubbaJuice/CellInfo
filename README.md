# Cell Info

When I was looking for an app that showed all of the data android provided on a cell, I couldn't find an app without bloat or one that I couldn't trust it was showing everything. I also struggled understanding what each of the fields meant. I hope to solve those issues with this app.

## App Summary

The app currently supports 4G and 5G and I will not be implementing 3G or 2G (or 1G). It is a work in progress. It is being developed using Android Studio.
